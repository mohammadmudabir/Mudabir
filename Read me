Develop a simple “Chat Messenger” that is connection oriented (i.e. it uses TCP) and that consists of a Client and a
Server Program.

1) The Server runs first and waits for some client to contact it.
2) Client Program starts and connects to the server.
3) Client-Server sends and receives messages.

Both the programs should be able to send and receive messages simultaneously and for this purpose you can use
threads. Each Program will have one “Input Thread” and one “Output Thread”. Input Thread waits for the input that
may come from the other program while Output Thread sends the typed message to the other program using
sockets.
(Hint: You can understand basics of Socket Programming with TCP by reading and practicing the code given in book
“Computer Networking – A Top-Down Approach by Kurose Ross” Page Number 165 and 168.)
